<h1>Redesign of the personal website</h1>

<h2>What is you site's primary purpose?</h2>

My site's primary purpose is a presentation of myself. It is a showreel website which will include interractivity to the user as a display of tool - but not as a real usage (no log for example).
It needs to be a valuable portfolio on one side and a meanigful blog side on the other without one taking too much importance compared to the other.

<h2>Who is your target audience?</h2>

On a wide view I target the coding world and development interested people. I think that nice looking websites and good user experience can target anyone as the subject does matter less than the browsing.  Nonetheless on the content :
I target fellow learners on my blog side in particular, may it be on development or else as it is a reflection on learning habits and approach through time
I target development interrested people on the more projects portfolio side which I expect to develop later on, but hopefully every of the projects would find their own target audience.

<h2>How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?</h2>

As I am using myself a Windows Surface and I like to browse internet on my phone, I would like my website to be very 'touchscreen' friendly and have a few nice features related to that (I do like the modals in bootstrap - everything that pops up without having to load a new page is good for me).
I do tend to like pictures in websites - good photos and illustrations are always attractive to me - But I'll have to find a way to justify it.
Otherwise I also enjoy vintage looking games, so a website which would include a game/discovery part (more foccussed on the blogging aspect) where clicking on some items in an image would reveal my experience of it and use in learning as a modal for example would be something I'll be keen to do.

<h2>How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?</h2>

A part portfolio, pretty straight forward on its design, probably looking as a slideshow.

A part blogging for my reflections so far. 
I am interrested to have an animation or photo with clickable items making related topics open up with my experience of them during the Phase-0 and further on experience in a learning driven by : Kindness, Effort and Integrity. I want the blog to match every noticeable aspect of the learning path I am taking as a tool to keep providing a good quality reflection on my learning for myself and a memory of it as well.
